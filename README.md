# Go ffmpeg

Small library for executing an ffmpeg or ffprobe process on a given file and getting a easy to use frame image or probe data. Works perfect with my [static-ffmpeg](`https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/ilovelili/static-ffmpeg`) Docker image

## Use case

- Extract frame images from video
- Check video duration
- etc
